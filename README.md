# Mckinley & Rice NodeJs Coding Challenge

> Welcome to the Mckinley & Rice Coding Challenge!


## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a  web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

This challenge is expected to take about 2-3 hours.


# MEAN Stack Developer Coding Challenge

The purpose of this coding challenge is to test a candidate's ability to
write concise, correct, elegant, robust and efficient code carrying the
duties of a *MEAN* (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) Stack
Developer. Also to familiarise the tools and libraries we will be using.

## Technologies

- MongoDB 3.4.x
- Express.js 4.16.x
- AngularJS 6.0.x
- Node.js v8.x (Use [.nvmrc](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage)
- ES6
- Webpack

## Libraries

- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) OR [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) - MongoDB connector
- [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) - *Optional, provides a rich Promise API
- Angular Material - *Optional, depending on Angular version of choice

## Testing

- [jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine) - Unit Test
- [protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor) - End-to-end Test

## Bonus

- Use of ES8 async/await
- Use of WebSocket using socket.io OR uWebSockets
- Mock responses based on environment development (for testing) vs production (from MongoDB)

## Task

- Develop a simple admin panel from which admin can add the products
- The product must have all these attributes productcategory, productsubcategory, productname, productcost, productsizes, image(there will be multiple product image)
- On click of the product image, all the product images will show in pop up slider
- In the frontend all the added products need to be listed with infinite scroll pagination
- The angular code and node code should be in the same project folder.
